# Bash

Move `config/bash/.bashrc` to your home directory. Change all the necessary PATH variables in this file to have the correct username.

Move all of the files in `fedora-38-configuration/config/bash/bin/` to `~/bin/` if you would like to use several helpful scripts. Otherwise, skip or add `fedora-38-configuration/config/bash/bin/` to your PATH in `.bashrc`.
