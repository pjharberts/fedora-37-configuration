# Nautilus (AKA Files)

## Preferences

Open Preferences, and change the following settings

- Menu
	- Show hidden files: On
- General
	- Action to Open Items: Single click

## Bookmarks

Open Terminal, and run the following command:

```
cd && mkdir com fun src doc/obs
```

Open Nautilus, and drag each created directory to the left sidebar to create a bookmark in the opposite order they were created (to avoid having to sort them).
