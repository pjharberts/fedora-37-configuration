# NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver

Install NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver by NVIDIA Corporation from software (it is proprietary and unratable, so it does not have any ratings).

It may take a while to download, and it will take even longer for the computer to finish booting back up. Restart when it is finished installing within Software, and DO NOT power off your computer.
